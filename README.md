# Flight Network Analysis
We extract flight networks from various open source data sources such as The Bureau of transportation and Statistics (US Bureau of transportation). By representing the network as graphs, we can study different salient features of the aviation transportation networks
traversed by specific airlines during a specific time window within certain country or continent. A preliminary analysis is performed 
in this jupyter notebook by computing centrality measures and shortest paths between two arbitrary locations.
